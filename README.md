- Energy-saving/Off mode (Only one light slighty on to deal with the state) (How should power plugs be handled?)
- Daylight Adjustment (E.g. No ceiling lights during daytime)
- Save scene when turning off, to reapply same scene when turning on
- Detect fast flickering of light state, indicating an issue, and disable the system for a few minutes
